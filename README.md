Tennis Data Rebase is a fun project that allows the user to contrast and compare the match-play data of their favourite players.
The current dataset consists of .sv files. I use python and flask web framework with simply html and css. But -  I have also used excel for basic data analysis - also fun.


Future ideas: 
- fuzzy matching names
- query player 1 vs player 2 scores for a given year
- add wta 
- Come up with a more contemporary analysis of serve effectiveness
- do  basic regression analysis to see if data comparisons are signifcant
  visualizations of the stats
- short youtube videos that tell a story behind the data

About the data set:
The Jeff Sackman ATP data (ie men's tennis) goes back to 1968. 
That being said, full match-play data with the service and break points is available back through 1991.
