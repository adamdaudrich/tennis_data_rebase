Tennis Data Rebase is a fun project that allows the user to contrast and compare the match-play data of their favourite players
The tools are a mysql database and python. I have also used excel - it definitely works well.

Current code and csv samples include Roger Federer's 2003 wimbledon scores and the 2023 davis cup match scores. 

Future ideas: 
- compare Andre Agassi's serve data from 1995 against 1999 on clay courts, and an analysis of how his game changed in that pivotal period in his career.
- Come up with a more contemporary analysis of serve effectiveness using the basic serve data
- create a front end so that the user can query and see visualizations of the stats
- short youtube videos that tell a story behind the data

About the data set:
The Jeff Sackman ATP data (ie men's tennis) goes back to 1968. 
That being said, full match-play data with the service and break points is available back through 1991.
