Tennis Data Rebase is a fun project that allows the user to contrast and compare the match-play data of their favourite players
The basic tools here of this are a mysql database and python and a little excel as well. I want the users to feel that they can do it. 

Current code and csv samples include Roger Federer's 2003 wimbledon scores and the 2023 davis cup match scores. 

Future ideas: 
- a comparison Andre Agassi's serve data from 1995 against 1999 on clay courts, and an analysis of how his game changed between those two years.
- re-interpreting the basic serve data to come up with a more contemporary anaylsis of serve effectiveness.
- creating a front end, so that the user can query and see visualizations of the stats
- youtube videos that tell a story behind the data

About the data set:
The Jeff Sackman ATP data (ie men's tennis) set is the first data set used, and it goes back to 1968. 
That being said, full match play play data including service and break points is available back through 1991.
